# jailer
A FreeBSD Jail Manager Written in Go (golang)

This is an educational endeavor to help me learn to program in Go. I'm retired and a hobbyist with no computer science background. My sole success so far has been writing a complete webserver application (frontend, middleware and backend) from scratch. It works but is undeployed. jailer is my first foray into a CLI app in Go.

I'm in no hurry so bear with me, please. This account was set up to preserve the project name.
